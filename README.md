# Sparen's Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) Mod for Factorio

This is a mod for Factorio that adds Personal Rapid Transit capabilities.

What is PRT? PRT is a grade-separated mass transit system using small automated pods on guideways. In practice, systems like the Heathrow Pods and Morgantown PRT have shown that it can be a practical solution for transit where the ridership does not justify the costs of building, running, and maintaining more complex transit systems, such as light rail.

In vanilla Factorio, player transport across the map us highly dependent on three modes (will be four soon, since we'll be able to corss bodies of water with the new vehicle coming out) - Walking (Power Armor - Exoskeleton + Concrete/Stone Brick), Trains (including Personal Trains), and Automobiles (Cars and Tanks, the latter of which is mainly used to run over spawners). 

As most players know, personal trains are a royal pain. If you lug around a train as extra storage space, it inevitably will block traffic while you do other tasks. If you carry the train with you, you need to manually refuel it, deconstruct it, etc. for every use. Although you can now call trains to you, it's still painful. Even with the help of many of the very good rail mods, it can still be annoying.

This PRT mod aims to provide another alternative.

# Mod Description

This mod implements grade-separated PRT in Factorio. It is currently in development, so take the implementation details with a grain of salt - see the design plans for more details.

Essentially, this mod provides a GUI, track, stations, and vehicles for PRT support. Do note that constructing the system is expensive - maximum capacity track is not cheap to build, and many pods are needed in order to provide quick, reliable service.
